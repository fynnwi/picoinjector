# picoinjector

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of this package is to implement analysis scripts and document calculations and estimations used for the development of a microfluidic picoinjector.

## Installation

You can install the development version of picoinjector from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("fynnwi/picoinjector")
```

## Content

1. Calculations to estimate hydraulic resistances in PTFE and Tygon tubing and the resulting flow rates: `vignette("hydraulic_resistance")`
2. Estimations to quantify the number of droplets contained in x cm of tubing: `vignette("droplet_volumes")`
3. Spin curve analysis of SU-8 3035 custom dilution: `vignette("spincurves")`





## To do

- implement colors
- electric field voltages Vpp, Vrms etc
- ORCID ID
