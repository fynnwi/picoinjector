The goal of this package is to implement analysis scripts and document
calculations and estimations used for the development of a microfluidic
picoinjector.

## Installation

You can install the development version of masterthesis from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("fynnwi/masterthesis")
```

## Content

1.  Calculations to estimate hydraulic resistances in PTFE and Tygon
    tubing and the resulting flow rates:
    `vignette("hydraulic_resistance")`
2.  Estimations to quantify the number of droplets contained in x cm of
    tubing: `vignette("droplet_volumes")`

## To do

-   implement colors
-   electric field voltages Vpp, Vrms etc
