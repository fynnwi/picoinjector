In cases in which there is limited information, random mutagenesis can be used to interrogate the uncertain determinants of protein function.Recombination methodologies access new combinations of functional variation and can shuffle disparate genetic elements to yield new chimeric proteins.Low-throughput screens can directly measure individual phenotypes and thus accurately isolate desired subpopulations. Screen throughput can be increased using indirect visible reporters that are strongly coupled to the desired phenotypes.Selections isolate functional variants through selective replication schemes or physical segregation. Selections operate simultaneously on entire populations and thus offer unparalleled throughput.},

	abstract = {De novo biocatalysts with non-natural functionality are accessible by computational enzyme design. The catalytic activities obtained for the initial designs are usually low, but can be optimized signiﬁcantly by directed evolution. Nevertheless, rate accelerations approaching the level of natural enzymes can only be achieved over many rounds of tedious and time-consuming laboratory evolution. In this work, we show that microﬂuidic-based screening using ﬂuorescence-activated droplet sorting ({FADS}) is ideally suited for efﬁcient optimization of designed enzymes with low starting activity, essentially straight out of the computer. We chose the designed retro-aldolase {RA}95.0, which had been previously evolved by conventional microtiter plate screening, as an example and reoptimized it using the microﬂuidic-based assay. Our results show that {FADS} is sufﬁciently sensitive to detect enzyme activities as low as kcat/Km = 0.5 M−1s−1. The ultra-high throughput of this system makes screening of large mutant libraries possible in which clusters of up to ﬁve residues are randomized simultaneously. Thus, combinations of beneﬁcial mutations can be identiﬁed directly, leading to large jumps in catalytic activity of up to 80-fold within a single round of evolution. By exploring several evolutionary trajectories in parallel, we identify alternative active site arrangements that exhibit comparably enhanced efﬁciency but opposite enantioselectivity.},

Incorporation of the stabilizer immediately upstream of a picoinjector or a combination of injectors greatly reduces pressure fluctuations enabling reproducible and effective picoinjection in systems where the pressure varies actively during operation. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the pressure stabilizer for an integrated platform for on-demand encapsulation of bacterial cells followed by picoinjection of reagents for lysing the encapsulated cells. The pressure stabilizer was also used for picoinjection of multiple displacement amplification ({MDA}) reagents to achieve genomic {DNA} amplification of lysed bacterial cells.},

An important method for accomplishing this is picoinjection, a technique in which reagents are injected into aqueous drops using an electric field. While picoinjection has been shown to allow the precise addition of reagents to drops, its compatibility with biological reactions is yet to be thoroughly demonstrated. Here, we investigate the compatibility of picoinjection with digital {RT}-{PCR} Taqman assays, reactions that incorporate nucleic acids, enzymes, and other common biological reagents. We find that picoinjection is compatible with this assay and enables the detection of {RNA} transcripts at rates comparable to workflows not incorporating picoinjection. We also find that picoinjection results in negligible transfer of material between drops and that the drops faithfully retain their compartmentalization.},

However, multiple proteases and endogenous inhibitors interact to govern {MP} activity, often leading to highly context-dependent protease function that unfortunately has impeded associated clinical utility. We present a method for rapidly assessing the activity of multiple specific proteases in small volumes ({\textless}20 μL) of complex biological fluids such as clinical samples that are available only in very limited amounts. It uses a droplet-based microfluidic platform that injects the sample into thousands of picoliter-scale droplets from a barcoded droplet library ({DL}) containing mixtures of unique, moderately selective {FRET}-based protease substrates and specific inhibitors and monitors hundreds of the reactions thus initiated simultaneously by tracking these droplets. Specific protease activities in the sample are then inferred from the reaction rates using a deconvolution technique, proteolytic activity matrix analysis ({PrAMA}). Using a nine-member {DL} with three inhibitors and four {FRET} substrates, we applied the method to the peritoneal fluid of subjects with and without the invasive disease endometriosis. The results showed clear and physiologically relevant differences with disease, in particular, decreased {MMP}-2 and {ADAM}-9 activities.},

While natural evolution based on selection is slow and gradual, directed evolution allows the fast and streamlined optimization of a phenotype under selective conditions. The potential of directed evolution for the discovery and optimization of enzymes is mostly limited by the throughput of the tools and methods available for screening. Over the past twenty years, versatile tools based on droplet microfluidics have been developed to address the need for higher throughput.

The root cause of poor quality data is typically associated with inadequate dilution of residual protein and chemical contaminants that variably inhibit Taq polymerase and primer annealing. The most susceptible, frustrating and often most interesting samples are those containing low abundant targets with small expression differences of 2-fold or lower. Here, Droplet Digital {PCR} ({ddPCR}) and {qPCR} platforms were directly compared for gene expression analysis using low amounts of purified, synthetic {DNA} in well characterized samples under identical reaction conditions. We conclude that for sample/target combinations with low levels of nucleic acids (Cq ≥ 29) and/or variable amounts of chemical and protein contaminants, {ddPCR} technology will produce more precise, reproducible and statistically significant results required for publication quality data. A stepwise methodology is also described to choose between these complimentary technologies to obtain the best results for any experiment.},

	abstract = {Using droplet microfluidic picoinjection as a reactant dosing technique is of great importance in assembling artificial cells and performing multistep reactions. However, the utilization of electricity in the existing picoinjection complicates the device fabrication and operation, and compromises the bioactivity of the encapsulated bio-ingredients. In this work, we propose an electricity-free picoinjection technique as an alternative to address these issues. Specifically, by precisely controlling the pressures inside the microfluidic channel, we can inject one reactant into the flowing droplets that contain another reactant without applying the electric field. Furthermore, the dosed volumes can be tuned by controlling the value of external pressure or the ratio of flow rates between the continuous and droplet phases. To demonstrate the robustness of the proposed picoinjection, we apply it to synthesize crystals and nanoparticles. In the synthesis of crystals, the proposed picoinjection eliminates the problem of device fouling that occurs in the current reactant dosing devices. In the synthesis of nanoparticles, the proposed picoinjection generates nanoparticles that are highly monodispersed. As a result, this simplified picoinjection potentially extends the application of droplet microfluidics to investigate reaction dynamics or biochemical processes in cells. Besides, by eliminating the electricity, the proposed picoinjection avoids the usages of large equipment such as large power supplies or complicate devices, enhancing the accessibility of the proposed picoinjection.},

	abstract = {Microinjection is an effective actuation technique used for precise delivery of molecules and cells into droplets or controlled delivery of genes, molecules, proteins, and viruses into single cells. Several microinjection techniques have been developed for actuating droplets and cells. However, they are still time-consuming, have shown limited success, and are not compatible with the needs of high-throughput ({HT}) serial microinjection. We present a new passive microinjection technique relying on pressure-driven fluid flow and pulsative flow patterns within an {HT} droplet microfluidic system to produce serial droplets and manage rapid and highly controlled microinjection into droplets. A microneedle is secured within the injection station to confine droplets during the microinjection. The confinement of droplets on the injection station prevents their movement or deformation during the injection process. Three-dimensional (3D) computational analysis is developed and validated to model the dynamics of multiphase flows during the emulsion generation. We investigate the influence of pulsative flows, microneedle parameters and synchronization on the efficacy of microinjection. Finally, the feasibility of implementing our microinjection model is examined experimentally. This technique can be used for tissue engineering, cells actuation and drug discovery as well as developing new strategies for drug delivery.},

A unified physical understanding of both passive and active droplet generation is beneficial for effectively developing new techniques meeting various demands arising from applications. Our review of passive approaches focuses on the characteristics and mechanisms of breakup modes of droplet generation occurring in microfluidic cross-flow, co-flow, flow-focusing, and step emulsification configurations. The review of active approaches covers the state-of-the-art techniques employing either external forces from electrical, magnetic and centrifugal fields or methods of modifying intrinsic properties of flows or fluids such as velocity, viscosity, interfacial tension, channel wettability, and fluid density, with a focus on their implementations and actuation mechanisms.

The droplet technology overcomes many problems of continuous flow, such as small sample reagent volume, no cross-contamination, and rapid chemical reaction. So microdroplets have an important position in the fields of single cell analysis, gene sequencing, and real-time diagnosis. This review focuses on the different methods and applications of microdroplet generation in microfluidics. The droplet generation methods are passive and active methods. The passive method does not require external force, while the active method requires external force such as external electric field, magnetic field, acoustic field, and laser field. It is predicted that the quantitative generation of droplets on demand in microfluidics will be the important direction for future research.

	abstract = {Segmented flow microfluidic devices offer an attractive means of studying crystallization processes. However, while they are widely employed for protein crystallization, there are few examples of their use for sparingly soluble compounds due to problems with rapid device fouling and irreproducibility over longer run-times. This article presents a microfluidic device which overcomes these issues, as this is constructed around a novel design of “picoinjector” that facilitates direct injection into flowing droplets. Exploiting a Venturi junction to reduce the pressure within the droplet, it is shown that passive injection of solution from a side-capillary can be achieved in the absence of an applied electric field. The operation of this device is demonstrated for calcium carbonate, where highly reproducible results are obtained over long run-times at high supersaturations. This compares with conventional devices that use a Y-junction to achieve solution loading, where in-channel precipitation of calcium carbonate occurs even at low supersaturations. This work not only opens the door to the use of microfluidics to study the crystallization of low solubility compounds, but the simple design of a passive picoinjector will find wide utility in areas including multistep reactions and investigation of reaction dynamics.},

Two methods based on passive flow focusing and active pico-injection are demonstrated to generate water-water-oil double emulsions, achieving a high generation frequency of {\textasciitilde}2.4 {kHz}. Through evaporation of the oil to break the double emulsions, the aqueous core can be released to form uniform-sized water-in-water droplets. Moreover, this technique can be used to fabricate aqueous microgels, and the introduction of the oil medium enables integration of droplet sorting to produce single-cell-laden hydrogels with a harvest rate of over 90\%. We believe that the demonstrated high-throughput generation and sorting of {ATPS} droplets represent an important tool to advance droplet-based tissue engineering and single-cell analyses.},

Microdroplets were generated in two different microfluidic devices designed to accommodate the requirements of both bulk syntheses. The epitaxial growth of {AuNSTs} inside the microdroplets allowed for a fine control of reagent mixing and local concentrations during particle formation. This is the first time branched gold {NPs} have been synthesised in a microfluidics platform. The monodispersity of the product was comparable to the synthesis in bulk, proving the potential of this technology for the continuous synthesis of high quality anisotropic {NPs} with improved reproducibility.},

Here, a method for the quantitative detection of ethanol in a microdroplet-based platform is described that can be used for screening cyanobacterial strains to identify those with the highest ethanol productivity levels. The detection of ethanol by enzymatic assay was optimized both in bulk and in microdroplets. In parallel, the encapsulation of engineered ethanol-producing cyanobacteria in microdroplets and their growth dynamics in microdroplet reservoirs were demonstrated. The combination of modular microdroplet operations including droplet generation for cyanobacteria encapsulation, droplet re-injection and pico-injection, and laser-induced fluorescence, were used to create this new platform to screen genetically engineered strains of cyanobacteria with different levels of ethanol production.},

In the last two decades, the development of droplet microfluidic systems, which incorporate these multiple unit operations into a workflow, has demonstrated unique capabilities in fields ranging from single-cell transcriptomic analyses to materials optimization. One unit operation that is sorely underdeveloped in droplet microfluidics is washing, exchange of the fluid in a droplet with a different fluid. Here, we demonstrate what we name the “pico-washer,” a unit operation capable of simultaneously adding fluid to and removing fluid from droplets in flow while requiring only a small footprint on a microfluidic chip. We describe the fabrication strategy, device architecture, and process parameters required for stable operation of this technology, which is capable of operating with {kHz} droplet throughput. Furthermore, we provide an image processing workflow to characterize the washing process with microsecond and micrometer resolution. Finally, we demonstrate the potential for integrated droplet workflows by arranging two of these unit operations in series with a droplet generator, describe a design rule for stable operation of the pico-washer when integrated into a system, and validate this design rule experimentally. We anticipate that this technology will contribute to continued development of the droplet microfluidics toolbox and the realization of novel droplet-based, multistep biological and chemical assays.},

Correspondingly, the analysis of individual cells from a heterogeneous population can reveal information not obtainable by ensemble measurements. Reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction ({RT}-{PCR}) is a widely used method that enables transcriptional profiling and sequencing analysis on bulk populations of cells. Major barriers to successfully implementing this technique for mammalian single-cell studies are the labor, cost, and low-throughput associated with current approaches. In this report, we describe a novel droplet-based microfluidic system for performing ∼50000 single-cell {RT}-{PCR} reactions in a single experiment while consuming a minimal amount of reagent. Using cell type-specific staining and {TaqMan} {RT}-{PCR} probes, we demonstrate the identification of specific cells from a mixed human cell population. The throughput, robust detection rate and specificity of this method makes it well-suited for characterizing large, heterogeneous populations of cells at the transcriptional level.},

Cell encapsulation in microgels allows the compartmentalized purification and tagmentation of {DNA}, while a microfluidic merger efficiently pairs each genome with a unique single-cell oligonucleotide barcode, allowing {\textgreater}50,000 single cells to be sequenced per run. The sequencing data is demultiplexed by barcode, generating groups of reads originating from single cells.

	abstract = {Micro total analytical systems ({mTAS}) are attractive to multiple ﬁelds that include chemistry, medicine and engineering due to their portability, low power usage, potential for automation, and low sample and reagent consumption, which in turn results in low waste generation. The development of fully-functional {mTAS} is an iterative process, based on the design, fabrication and testing of multiple prototype microdevices. Typically, microfabrication protocols require a week or more of highly-skilled personnel time in high-maintenance cleanroom facilities, which makes this iterative process cost-prohibitive in many locations worldwide. Rapid-prototyping tools, in conjunction with the use of polydimethylsiloxane ({PDMS}), enable rapid development of microﬂuidic structures at lower costs, circumventing these issues in conventional microfabrication techniques. Multiple rapid-prototyping methods to fabricate {PDMSbased} microﬂuidic devices have been demonstrated in literature since the advent of soft-lithography in 1998; each method has its unique advantages and drawbacks. Here, we present a tutorial discussing current rapid-prototyping techniques to fabricate {PDMS}-based microdevices, including softlithography, print-and-peel and scaffolding techniques, among other methods, speciﬁcally comparing resolution of the features, fabrication processes and associated costs for each technique. We also present thoughts and insights towards each step of the iterative microfabrication process, from design to testing, to improve the development of fully-functional {PDMS}-based microﬂuidic devices at faster rates and lower costs.},

Thus, we herein demonstrate the continuous, passive, and size-based separation of main and satellite droplets using the deterministic lateral displacement ({DLD}) array method. For the purpose of this study, we designed and employed microfluidic devices comprised of an upstream symmetric flow-focusing {MFDG} and a downstream {DLD} array composed of polydimethylsiloxane ({PDMS}). Initially, we produced water-in-oil (W/O) droplets containing main droplets of ∼61.1 μm diameter in addition to satellite droplets of 1–30 μm diameter in a hydrophobic {MFDG}, and we report the successful separation of the main and satellite droplets through a single-step {DLD} array with a critical diameter (Dc) of 37.1 μm. Furthermore, we demonstrated the generation and separation of single-phase or biphasic (i.e. Janus or core–shell) oil-in-water (O/W) main and satellite droplets using a hydrophilic {MFDG} and a {DLD} array. Finally, in addition to the removal of main and satellite W/O droplets, we also fractionated satellite droplets of different sizes into three groups (i.e., 21.4, 10.1, and 4.9 μm average diameter) using a device with three-step {DLD} arrays each having different Dc values (i.e., 37.1, 11.6, and 7.0 μm).},

There is no added chelator to reduce the Ca activity in either of the two strategies. The two fabrication strategies are implemented using a flow-focusing and picoinjection modules in a single {PDMS} chip. Aqueous alginate solution was emulsified and infused with {CaCl}2 solution as the squeezed droplet pass the picoinjection channel; consequently, monodisperse, spherical, and structurally homogeneous Ca-alginate beads were obtained. Monodisperse alginate microgel populations with a mean diameter in the range of 8 to 28 μm and standard deviation less than 1 μm were successfully generated using microfluidic channels with various dimensions and controlling the flow parameters. Monodisperse but also non-spherical particles with diameters 6 to 15 μm were also fabricated when picoinjecting Na-alginate solution in emulsified aqueous {CaCl}2 droplets. The Ca-alginate microbeads fabricated with tailormade size in the range from sub-cellular and upwards were in both strategies realized without any use of chelators or change in {pH} conditions, which is considered a significant advantage for further exploitation as encapsulation process for improved enzymatic activity and cell viability.},

The enhanced stability of {dsGUVs} enables the sequential loading of these compartments with biomolecules, namely purified transmembrane and cytoskeleton proteins by microfluidic pico-injection technology. This constitutes an experimental demonstration of a successful bottom-up assembly of a compartment with contents that would not self-assemble to full functionality when simply mixed together. Following assembly, the stabilizing oil phase and droplet shells are removed to release functional self-supporting protocells to an aqueous phase, enabling them to interact with physiologically relevant matrices.},

	abstract = {The multiphase flow of droplets is widespread and used for both biological and nonbiological applications alike. However, the ensemble interactions of such systems are inherently nonlinear and complex, compounded by interfacial effects, making it a difficult many-body problem. In comparison, the self-assembly dynamics of solid particles in flow have long been studied and exploited in the field of inertial microfluidics. Here, we report novel self-assembly dynamics of liquid drops in microfluidic channels that contrast starkly with the established paradigm of inertial microfluidics, which stipulates that higher inertia leads to better spatial ordering. Instead, we find that ordering can be negatively correlated with inertia, while Dean flow can achieve long-range spatial periodicity on length scales at least 3 orders of magnitude greater than the drop diameter. Experimentally, we decouple droplet generation from ordering, enabling independent and systematic variation of key parameters, especially in ranges practical to droplet microfluidics. We find the inertia-dependent emergence of preferred drop separations and show that surfactant effects can influence the longitudinal ordering of multidrop arrays. The dynamics we describe have immediate utility to droplet microfluidics, where the ability to order drops is key to the streamlined integration of on-chip incubation with deterministic drop manipulation downstream─two important functions for biological assays. To this end, we demonstrate the use of passive inertial drop self-assembly to combine a delay line with picoinjection. These results not only present a largely unexplored direction for inertial microfluidics but also show the practical benefit of its unification with the versatile field of droplet microfluidics.},

The T-junction design for picoinjection is convenient in adding picoliter reagents into passing droplets to initiate reactions. However, conventional picoinjectors face difficulties in eliminating cross-contamination between droplets, preventing them from widespread use in sensitive biological and molecular assays. Here, we introduce stepinjection, which uses a T-junction with a stepped channel design to elevate the diffusional buffer zone into the main channel and consequently increases the pressure difference between droplets and the inlet of the injection channel. To demonstrate the stepinjector’s ability to perform contamination-sensitive enzymatic assays, we inject casein fluorescein isothiocyanate ({FITC}-casein) into a mixture of savinase and savinase-free (labeled with a red fluorescent dye) droplets. We observe no cross-contamination using stepinjection but find a severe cross-talk using an optimal picoinjection design. We envision that the simple, tunable, and reliable stepinjector can be easily integrated in various droplet processing devices, and facilitate various biomedical and biochemical applications including multiplex digital {PCR}, single-cell sequencing, and enzymatic screening.},

The analysis indicates that the enhanced coalescence is due to the combined effects of dipole–dipole interaction between droplets and dielectrophoresis between individual droplets and the applied non-uniform field. The present study shows that a non-uniform electric field and the induced dielectrophoretic effect can accelerate the coalescence and phase separation of micro-emulsions. These results may provide useful guidance in designing an optimum electrode configuration for efficient electrocoalescence.},

	abstract = {A high-throughput method for single cell screening by microfluidic droplet sorting is applied to a whole-genome mutated yeast cell library yielding improved production hosts of secreted industrial enzymes. The sorting method is validated by enriching a yeast strain 14 times based on its α-amylase production, close to the theoretical maximum enrichment. Furthermore, a 10(5) member yeast cell library is screened yielding a clone with a more than 2-fold increase in α-amylase production. The increase in enzyme production results from an improvement of the cellular functions of the production host in contrast to previous droplet-based directed evolution that has focused on improving enzyme protein structure. In the workflow presented, enzyme producing single cells are encapsulated in 20 {pL} droplets with a fluorogenic reporter substrate. The coupling of a desired phenotype (secreted enzyme concentration) with the genotype (contained in the cell) inside a droplet enables selection of single cells with improved enzyme production capacity by droplet sorting. The platform has a throughput over 300 times higher than that of the current industry standard, an automated microtiter plate screening system. At the same time, reagent consumption for a screening experiment is decreased a million fold, greatly reducing the costs of evolutionary engineering of production strains.},

	abstract = {Droplet microfluidics is a technique that has the ability to compartmentalize reactions in sub nano- (or pico-) liter volumes that can potentially enable millions of distinct biological assays to be performed on individual cells. In a typical droplet microfluidic system, droplets are manipulated by pressure-based flows. This has limited the fluidic operations that can be performed in these devices. Digital microfluidics is an alternative microfluidic paradigm with precise control and manipulation over individual droplets. Here, we implement an integrated droplet-digital microfluidic (which we call ‘{ID}2M’) system in which common fluidic operations (i.e. droplet generation, cell encapsulation, droplet merging and mixing, droplet trapping and incubation, and droplet sorting) can be performed. With the addition of electrodes, we have been able to create droplets on-demand, tune their volumes on-demand, and merge and mix several droplets to produce a dilution series. Moreover, this device can trap and incubate droplets for 24 h that can consequently be sorted and analyzed in multiple n-ary channels (as opposed to typical binary channels). The {ID}2M platform has been validated as a robust on-demand screening system by sorting fluorescein droplets of different concentration with an efficiency of ∼96\%. The utility of the new system is further demonstrated by culturing and sorting tolerant yeast mutants and wild-type yeast cells in ionic liquid based on their growth profiles. This new platform for both droplet and digital microfluidics has the potential to be used for screening different conditions on-chip and for applications like directed evolution.},
